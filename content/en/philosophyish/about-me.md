Born in 1990. Living in Ukraine. Could have become a mathematician and gone abroad (was in the IMO 2007). Toward the end of high school (2006–2007), I fell into a negative psychological state that lasted for many years (stayed at home, did nothing, and felt awful). I don’t know what it was, how such a thing is even possible, or why it happened to me. In the end, I "had a childhood but no youth", and now I'm "in a deep hole" (at this point, more in a practical sense than a psychological one). 

From 2015 to 2020, I read, thought, and made notes "for myself" about what I consider philosophy at its best. In 2020, I compiled my notes into texts and tried to reach out to philosophers in Ukraine and Russia to ask what I should do next, but almost none of them replied, and I "dropped out". Thus, most of the notes from which the texts written as of now (in 2025) are composed were made between 2015 and 2020.

Most of my favorite authors are not professional philosophers, but philosophizing scientists. Their reflections are not fundamental in the philosophical sense (for example, they assume the existence of the world without caveats) and are often "naive" (unlike professional philosophers, philosophizing scientists don’t know who said what over the last 3000 years and may "repeat others' mistakes"), but are much more substantive. My texts are also naive and non-fundamental in that sense. They are reflections on what caused wonder or anxiety in me, and I don’t know whether they reduce to what others have said before.

The second thing that matters to me is the realization of a fictional idea that took shape over many years. It turned out I’m almost incapable of writing fiction. The essence of the idea is an allegory expressing the psychological process of an "existential crisis" and the accompanying philosophical search, told through a fantastical story about a group of people trying to hold an ancient castle against dark forces.

My base language is Russian, and English is pretty bad; I use tools to help with translation.
